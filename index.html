            Our Goal here at <strong>SHOW me the Stats (QB Edition)</strong> is
            to present your favorite Quarterback's seasonal data in a way that
            makes sense! Think about how many times have you gone to a player's
            stats page and seen data listed in tables, like the ones below. Now
            think about how long it takes you to find the stats your looking for
            and break it down or make calculations. It can take some time. This
            is where we come in. Whether it be percentages, or yards and TDs per
            game, or per opponent we desire to <strong>VISUALIZE</strong> this
            data and let your <strong>EYES</strong> do the thinking allowing you
            to spend more time strategizing.
          </p>
          <p>
            In these examples we have provided tables of each QB's Data for
            reference.

                  The Cleveland Brown's Baker Mayfield had a 2018 season was one
                  for the record books. After not starting the first 3 games of
                  the season he still managed to throw for 27 Touchdwons. That
                  was the most by any rookie Quarterback since Peyton Manning or
                  Russell Westbrook! He also managed to hold above a 50%
                  Completion Percentage for 13 out of 14 games with 65.8% and a
                  TD/INT Ratio of 1.92. Not bad. He was most definitely a
                  crutial part the Browns completing a 7-8-1 season after a
                  extremely disappointing 0-16 2017 regular season.

                  The Jacksonville Jaguars Blake Bortles was in his 4th NFL
                  season in 2018 and it was a bit of a struggle compared to his
                  2017 season. Bortles and The Jags finished the 2017 season at
                  the NFC Championships with a loss to the New England Patriots.
                  The 2018 season ended with the Jags not making the playofs.
                  Bortles finished 2018 with an average completion percentage of
                  60%, but in spite of this we see that for The 2018 season he
                  finished with a TD/INT ratio of 1.18. YIKES!
